TheSEO llms txt Generator
A lightweight and future-focused WordPress plugin that automatically generates a dynamic llms.txt file at the root of your site.
llms.txt is an emerging helper format aimed at AI crawlers and language models such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google Gemini.
With this plugin, you can clearly define:
Your site’s main topics
Content clusters
Preferred citation rules
Context and positioning for language models
Priority and deprioritised sections
Multilingual intent (NL/EN)

The plugin dynamically outputs a clean text/plain file at:
/llms.txt
so AI crawlers receive structured signals about how your site should be interpreted.
